# Calorie-Burnt-Prediction
# üî• Calorie Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a Machine Learning-powered web application that predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity based on various physiological parameters. It's designed to help users better understand their workout efficiency and stay motivated to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Predicts calories burned based on:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Height (cm)
  - Weight (kg)
  - Workout duration (minutes)
  - Heart rate (bpm)
  - Body temperature (¬∞C)
- ‚úÖ Interactive web interface built with Flask
- ‚úÖ Motivational feedback with emojis
- ‚úÖ Real-time predictions
- ‚úÖ Error handling and user input validation
